# ArchLinux Systems and Software


This file is used to store all information that i have found in my research on types of systems, and software
that are needed for an ArchLinux environment. Whilst this file talks specifically about ArchLinux based
distro's, a large portion of the information noted here will translate to other linux distro's and even
other operating systems.
